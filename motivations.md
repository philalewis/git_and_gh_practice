I am changing my career for multiple reasons. The downsides of my current industry (environmental remediation and consulting) include:
1. Low pay
2. Deal with nothing but headaches, including contaminated sites, leaking underground storage tanks, random waste like drums of used oil, etc.
3. Very much a solo type of industry. People don't generally want to help with anything.
4. A lot of liability games. I'm tired of it.
5. I haven't advanced very far in the industry.
6. Constantly have to deal with regulators and gas station owners, and the two groups kind of hate each other.
7. I've just finished 3 years of chemotherapy for lymphoma and I suspect (though proof is impossible) that my cancer was caused by exposure to chlorinated solvents in dirty wells at Air Force bases.
